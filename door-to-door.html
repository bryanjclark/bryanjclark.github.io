          Dome</a>. Doors at 5, event at 7. It's probably your only guaranteed
          chance to see him in-person if you live in the PNW - and you don't
          wanna miss out! (In 2016, his Seattle visit was when that lil birdie
          landed on the podium; I'll always regret missing that moment.) Be sure
          to get there early; I don't imagine the whole place will fill up, but
          his rallies are massively popular and there isn't always room!</p>

            Ballard</a>. We'll have a quick training, then head out to the
            surrounding neighborhood to knock doors that the campaign has
            identified for us. Bring good walking shoes, a jacket + umbrella,
            and some water/snacks. We'll likely meet up at a nearby brewery
            afterwards to celebrate!</p>

        <p>I'm aiming to host an event-per-week
        from here on out - these are just the ones I've got scheduled at this
        point. Of course, many-thousands of other volunteers are doing the
        same, so you can find all those events over at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.map.berniesanders.com">map.berniesanders.com</a>!</p>
