          surrounding neighborhood to knock doors that the campaign has
          identified for us. Bring good walking shoes, a jacket + umbrella,
          and some water/snacks. <b>NOTE:</b> There are other Bernie Victory Captains hosting canvasses at this exact spot later in the day, too!</p>

          <p>I'm aiming to host an event-per-week
            from here on out - these are just the ones I've got scheduled at this
            point. Of course, many-thousands of other volunteers are doing the
            same, so you can find all those events over at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.map.berniesanders.com">map.berniesanders.com</a>!</p>
