          Transition to React Native</a> (2020): An overview of Khan Academy's mobile
          apps moving from React Native from 2017 to 2020. Some of it's
          technical, but much of it is about the higher-level things you might
          expect if you're considering this change!

          Navigation Transitions</a> (2019): A thorough walkthrough of setting up
          custom screen-to-screen animated transitions in iOS. This is one of
          the trickier bits in working with UIKit - I've long-wanted a thorough
          walkthrough like this, so when I was building this up for Locket, I
          made this tutorial to help others learn it too.

          Your App with a Weighted GPA</a> (2016): Individual bug reports are
          super-handy for precisely tracking the fix of an issue - but
          too-often, piles of UI nits get ignored, even when they add up to a
          poor overall experience! Give this approach a shot, it's worked well
          in a few projects over the years!

          You'll Be Missed</a> (2015): Undoubtably the best music service of all
          time, Rdio is now long gone. But back when was winding down, I grabbed
          screenshots and tried to write up what made it such a comfy place to
          discover and cherish your music.
